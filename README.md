Map Timeline and Point of Interest Viewer

Long story short, this webpage has a series of maps that, when the slider at the bottom is moved it will move through those maps. 
There's a label above the slider handle that shows the current year.
The POI checkboxes at the top will toggle various POI on and off on the map.
A button on the top left will switch between original map and redrawn maps, maintaining the current year position.
There are POI that can be set to appear on specific dates or ranges of dates. These POIs can have photos, descriptions, or whatever in them.
